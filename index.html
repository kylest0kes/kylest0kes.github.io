                            <p class="card-text">Greetings World!  My name is Kyle Stokes and I am 27 years old and I am a Orlando native. Every since I was a child I have been around computers.  Growing up, my father, a lawyer, and I were the only people in our household who had a personal desktop.  Granted, it was mostly for games at that time, but as I got older my interests slowly gravated to the more interesting details on the websites I was using everyday.  After MySpace was released to the public in 2003, and I discovered the ability to edit the code on your page for personalization, I became hooked, spending hours tweaking the source code and adding my own additions pulled from websites to take my page customization to the next level, to much envy of my friends. With the advent of Youtube in 2005, I began to ocassionaly attempt to teach myself various aspects of web design and coding, with little succes. Yet I persisted, aimless and slowly, into my later years.</p>
                            <p class="card-text">In my later years I spent some time in the Pacific Northwest, specifically Seattle, Washington, one of the nations fastest growing hubs for the tech industry.  In my brief time there, I was lucky enough to cross paths with some of the incredible people working for tech giants such as Amazon, and Microsoft.  After our enlightening conversations on the industry from a first hand account, the passion was reignighted more intensly than ever.  With a new life goal in mind, and upon arrival back in Florida, I have enrolled in the UCF Coding Bootcamp, ready to face this challenge head on with everything in my spirit.</p>
